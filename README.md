# RegExpress [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RegExpress/regexpress.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/RegExpress/regexpress)

## About

RegExpress is an online tool for building regular expressions. Using RegExpress, you can create a regex by constructing a diagram with drag and drop components, circumventing the need to learn or look up regular expression symbols. RegExpress also allows you to visualize any regular expression as a diagram, then edit it to your liking without ever having to touch the regex string itself. 

Visit [regexpress.io](http://www.regexpress.io) to use the tool, or fork and clone the repo to contribute.

RegExpress was created at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com) in 2014, and continues to be maintained. We welcome your contributions of any kind! Check out our [issues](https://github.com/RegExpress/regexpress/issues/) to see what needs to be done, or add your own.
